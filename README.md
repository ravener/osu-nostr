## Disclaimer

This project has no connection with osu!'s developers. osu! is a trademark of ppy Ltd.

The account is built by the community for the community.

Nostr also provides the ability to 'zap' posts which is basically tipping in bitcoins, I have vowed to save up any zaps it gets and use it solely to buy osu!supporter gifts to other players meaning it will make someone's day happy and also directly support osu!'s development so I don't make any profit from this.
